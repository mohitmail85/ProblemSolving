## Introduction 
 
In this project, we tackle common DSA problems and provide efficient solutions using C#. The goal is to help developers understand and implement these algorithms in their own projects. 
 
## Installation 
 
To use the solutions provided in this project, follow these steps: 
 
1. Clone the repository:  git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git> ](https://github.com/mohitmail85/ProblemSolving.git) 
2. Open the project in your preferred C# development environment (e.g., Visual Studio). 
3. Build the project to ensure all dependencies are resolved. 
 
## Usage 
 
The project is organized into separate folders, each representing a different DSA problem. Each folder contains a C# file with the solution code and an optional README file explaining the problem and approach. 
 
To use a specific solution: 
 
1. Navigate to the desired problem's folder. 
2. Open the corresponding C# file. 
3. Copy the code and integrate it into your own project as needed. 
 
Feel free to modify the code to suit your specific requirements or optimize it further. 
 
## Contributing 
 
Contributions to this project are welcome! If you have any improvements or additional DSA problem solutions, please follow these steps: 
 
1. Fork the repository. 
2. Create a new branch:  git checkout -b feature/your-feature  
3. Make your changes and commit them:  git commit -m 'Add your feature'  
4. Push to the branch:  git push origin feature/your-feature  
5. Open a pull request. 
 
Please ensure that your code follows the project's coding conventions and includes appropriate documentation.
